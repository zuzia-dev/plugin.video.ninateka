## DRM protected streams ##


Ninateka's content is DRM protected and requires the proprietary decryption module Widevine CDM for playback. You will be prompted to install this if you're starting the addon without the binary installed.

Most Android devices have built-in support for Widevine DRM and doesn't require any additional binaries. You can see if your Android device supports Widevine DRM by using the [DRM Info](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidfung.drminfo) app available in Play Store.
